# FAMU-FSU Senior Design Team 301 : SouthEastCon Hardware Competition 

The IEEE SoutheastCon Student Hardware Competition is a yearly robotic design contest. 
This yearâ€™s game is to design an autonomous robot to do at least 1 of 2 tasks, within 3 minutes.

## 

Here you'll find the code for team 301's automated robot Ezio! As well as all other code related to the project.

### Ezio
Ezio is team 301 response to the souteascon harwarecompetition of 2020 1st challenge. He will stack from the bottom in a reverse PI Order.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Software Overview

The software was designed to resemble a Finite State Machine. 
The tasks needed to do by Ezio were separated into modules, or states. 
Depending on the amount of blocks stacked, Ezio will use one state or another
in order to finish the task. Each state contains multiple functions in order 
to modularize the software's implementation. This type of desing allows 
for easier implemenation and testing as the project progresses.
